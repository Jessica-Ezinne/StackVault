# StackVault- DeFi Yield Aggregator

A sophisticated yield aggregator smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain that automatically finds and compounds the best yield opportunities across multiple DeFi protocols.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Multi-Strategy Yield Optimization**: Automatically allocates funds across STX staking, lending protocols, and LP farming
- **Risk-Based Vault Management**: Three risk levels (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive) with tailored strategy allocation
- **Automated Compounding**: Harvest and reinvest earnings automatically to maximize yield
- **Share-Based Accounting**: ERC-4626-like vault standard with precise share calculations

### Advanced Features

- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Admin-controlled strategy optimization based on market conditions
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality for security and risk management
- **Fee Management**: Configurable platform and performance fees with treasury integration
- **Multi-Vault Support**: Users can participate in multiple vaults with different risk profiles

## Supported Strategies

| Strategy         | Protocol      | Risk Level    | Target APY |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| STX Staking      | Native Stacks | Low (3/10)    | 12%        |
| Lending Protocol | Arkadiko      | Medium (5/10) | 8%         |
| LP Farming       | ALEX          | High (7/10)   | 15%        |

### Key Components

#### Vault System

- **Risk Levels**: Conservative (1), Balanced (2), Aggressive (3)
- **Minimum Deposits**: Configurable per vault
- **Share Calculation**: `shares = (assets * total_shares) / total_assets`

#### Fee Structure

- **Platform Fee**: 0.5% (configurable, max 10%)
- **Performance Fee**: 10% on generated yield
- **Treasury**: Automatic fee collection and management
